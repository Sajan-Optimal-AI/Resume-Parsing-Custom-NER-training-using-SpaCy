# 1.Dataset is available at https://github.com/laxmimerit/Resume-and-CV-Summarization-and-Parsing-with-Spacy-in-Python/blob/master/train_data.pkl
# Dataset includes 200 resumes and all of the texts are arranged in such a way that two portions.First one is an paragraph explanation and second one is entities list with start and end character information.

# SpaCY Version:
# Ltest version of SpaCy is not supportive to these codes.So for code implementation set the worksheet with 
!python -m spacy download nl
!pip install pyldavis

# Aout the result:
     1.Trained Model doing fine with locating entities which is required for high priority idea about the resume holders.

     2.But Model is not showing outstanding performance for the resumes which are framed with high complex layouts and toomuch of data for a page.ie.dissimilar to the resume data what has been used for training.

# SpaCy Advanced Transformer model based codes could be solving similar issues with delicately.
